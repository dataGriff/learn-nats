## GitHub Copilot Instructions for This Repository

Welcome! This repository is for learning and experimenting with NATS, a high-performance messaging system. GitHub Copilot can help you get the most out of your learning experience here.

### How to Use Copilot Effectively

1. **Request Code Examples**
	- Ask Copilot to generate NATS client code in your preferred language (Go, Python, Node.js, etc.).
	- Example: "Show me how to publish and subscribe to a subject in NATS using Python."

2. **Explore NATS Concepts**
	- Ask for explanations of NATS features like subjects, queues, JetStream, or message patterns.
	- Example: "What is a queue group in NATS and how does it work?"

3. **Troubleshoot and Debug**
	- Paste error messages or code snippets and ask Copilot for help.
	- Example: "Why does my NATS client get a connection refused error?"

4. **Learn by Doing**
	- Request step-by-step guides or tasks for learning NATS features.
	- Example: "Give me a simple exercise to try NATS JetStream."

5. **Documentation Help**
	- Ask Copilot to summarize or clarify documentation in the repo.
	- Example: "Summarize the main points from the README."

### Best Practices

- Be specific in your prompts for better suggestions.
- Use code blocks when sharing code or errors.
- Review and test all code suggestions before using them in production.

### Example Prompts

- "Write a NATS subscriber in Go that prints all messages on 'updates'."
- "How do I set up a local NATS server?"
- "Explain the difference between NATS core and JetStream."
